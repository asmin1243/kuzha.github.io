I am a postdoc in the Building Technology and Urban Systems Division at [Lawrence Berkeley National Lab](http://www.lbl.gov).

My current research focuses on new-generation computing tools for design and operation of building systems, including Model Predictive Control (MPC) methods. My work also includes implementation of the MPC methods and computing tools on real-world projects.

My Ph.D. projects at [Polytechnique Montral](www.polymtl.ca) focused on modeling, optimization and predictive control of building energy systems. Part of my work was contributed to the [IEA EBC Annex 67](http://www.annex67.org/) project on "Energy Flexible Buildings". I also worked closely with Canadian industry partners on cold climate heat pumps and smart thermostats.

I am a marathon runner. I enjoy hiking in the nature and reading Haruki Murakami in my spare time.
