Bonjour-Hi!

My name is Kun. I am a Researcher in the Building Technology and Urban Systems Division at [Lawrence Berkeley National Lab (LBNL)](http://www.lbl.gov).

## My work and research

My research focuses on new-generation computational tools for optimal design and operation of building systems, including Model Predictive Control (MPC) methods. My work also includes implementation, deployment and testing of the MPC methods and computational tools on real buildings.

## My background and history

I received my master and Ph.D. programs at [Polytechnique Montreal](http://www.polymtl.ca), where my research focused on modeling, optimization and predictive control of building energy systems. Part of my work was contributed to the [IEA EBC Annex 67](http://www.annex67.org/) project on "Energy Flexible Buildings". I also worked closely with Canadian industry partners on cold climate heat pumps and smart thermostats.

## My hobby
I am a marathon runner. I enjoy hiking in the nature and reading Haruki Murakami in my spare time.
