I am a postdoc in the Building Technology and Urban Systems Division at [Lawrence Berkeley National Lab](www.lbl.gov).

My research focuses on new-generation computing tools for design and operation of building systems, including Model Predictive Control (MPC) methods. My work also includes implementation of the MPC methods and computing tools on real-world projects.

I am a marathon runner. I enjoy hiking in the nature and reading Haruki Murakami.
