Bonjour-Hi!

My name is Kun. I am a Researcher in the Energy Technologies Area at [Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory](http://www.lbl.gov), a.k.a. Berkeley Lab or LBNL, a U.S. Department of Energy Lab affiliated to UC Berkeley.

## My research interests

My previous and ongoing research focuses on development of next-generation computational tools for optimal design and operation of energy systems in buildings and communities, advanced modelling and control methods including Model Predictive Control (MPC), data-driven modelling and machine learning approaches. My work includes implementation, deployment and testing of the models, control methods and computational tools both in simulations and real-world systems for energy efficiency, flexibility, resilience and sustainability. The applications of my work fall broadly under smart buildings, smart grids and Internet of Things.

## My background

I received my Master and Ph.D. degrees from [Polytechnique Montréal](http://www.polymtl.ca), the engineering school of Université de Montréal. During my graduate studies, I contributed actively to the IEA (International Energy Agency) EBC (Energy in Buildings and Communities) programme [Annex 67](http://www.annex67.org/) project on "Energy Flexible Buildings" by joining in expert meetings, presenting my research outcomes and co-authoring reports and papers with international collaborators.

In two other projects, I worked closely with two Canadian industry partners on cold climate heat pumps and smart thermostats.

## My teaching philosophy

Instead of imperatively delivering, I see teaching as a way of exchanging thoughts, knowledge and experience with students. And I enjoy that process. I have had teaching experience both at undergraduate and graduate levels and consistently give training sessions and seminars to students and colleagues in my work.

I believe in active and interactive learning. Since everyone has their unique way of learning, I try to cautiously adapt myself in different ways of communication so that a broad spectrum of learning styles can be captured.

## My hobbies
I am a marathon runner. I enjoy hiking in the nature and reading Haruki Murakami in my spare time.
