Bonjour-Hi!

My name is Kun. I am a Researcher in the Building Technology and Urban Systems Division at [Lawrence Berkeley National Lab (LBNL)](http://www.lbl.gov).

## My research interests

My research focuses on next-generation computational tools for optimal design and operation of building systems, including Model Predictive Control (MPC) methods. My work also includes implementation, deployment and testing of the MPC methods and computational tools on real buildings.

## My background

I received my Master and Ph.D. degrees from [Polytechnique Montréal](http://www.polymtl.ca), the engineering school of the University of Montréal. Part of my graduate work contributed to the IEA (International Energy Agency) EBC [Annex 67](http://www.annex67.org/) project on "Energy Flexible Buildings". I also worked closely with Canadian industry partners on cold climate heat pumps and smart thermostats.

## My hobbies
I am a marathon runner. I enjoy hiking in the nature and reading Haruki Murakami in my spare time.
