Building thermal mass, which can be used as a thermal storage system, can provide energy flexibility potential for demand response (DR). This flexibility refers to the deviation of energy demand against normal operation of building mechanical system during a certain period, for instance, during grid peak hours. This paper assesses several key performance indicators (KPIs) to quantify the building energy flexibility. A typical Canadian house is used as a case study and a simple setpoint temperature modulation approach is implemented. Simulation results show that the amount of flexible energy is quite significant, especially during colder weather. The energy rebound effect after the DR event is also analyzed and the implemented control strategy saves about 20% of energy for a DR duration of 2 hours without thermal comfort compromise.
