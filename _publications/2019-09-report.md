This report includes 33 examples of energy flexibility in buildings, where many types of buildings, storage, energy systems and control strategies have been investigated via simulations and/or measurements. This will hopefully provide the reader with valuable insight into the different ways of obtaining Energy Flexibility from
buildings and, thus, be a source of inspiration for future research and development in this area.
The report can either be read in full, or the reader may select specific examples of special interest.
