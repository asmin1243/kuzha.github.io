In the IEA EBC Annex 67 project, different methods have been applied to simulate energy flexibility potential of building components, single buildings and building clusters. We investigated the performance of different storage and generation solutions concerning e.g. power, energy, ramp up and down time, peak shaving, time shifting, uncertainty, etc. and their deployment in both new and existing buildings. The objective of this report is to show cases of these different approaches. In each chapter, one case study is described focusing on methodology used and the table below is the summary of each study. Each chapter is written based on relevant publications listed in the end of the chapter.

The aim of the case studies is further to inspire peoples who wish to perform
simulations for determination of the possible energy flexibility of actual buildings.
