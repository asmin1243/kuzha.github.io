Energy flexibility represents a key building feature for the future energy systems, where the
deployment of renewable energies will increase and the possibility to adapt the energy loads
according to the requirements of the grid will be needed. Nevertheless, despite the given
attention, a uniform understanding and a commonly accepted definition is still not in place for this
building concept. The lack of a clear international framework for the requirements and properties
of energy flexible buildings leads to numerous definitions that are being developed in parallel and
are applied in the context of specific case studies when evaluating and/or quantifying energy
flexibility. In this regard, the report aims to provide a unique and shared vision about energy
flexibility, starting from the adoption of a common definition and terminology and from the analysis
of the indicators currently available in literature than can be used for quantifying flexibility.
According to these first achievements, a common methodology for quantifying and labelling
energy flexibility has been defined and tested, in order to complete the general framework on
energy flexibility.
