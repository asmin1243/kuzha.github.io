The increasing amount of operational data in buildings opens up new methods for improving building performance through advanced controls. Although predictive control has been widely investigated in the literature, field demonstrations still remain rare. Alternatively, model-based controls can provide similar improvement while being easier to implement in real buildings. This paper investigates three data-driven model-based control strategies to improve the cooling performance of commercial and institutional buildings: (a) chiller sequencing, (b) free cooling, and (c) supply air temperature reset. These energy efficiency measures are applied to an existing commercial building in Canada with data from summer 2020 and 2021. The impact of each measure is individually assessed, as well as their combined effects. The results show that all three of the measures together reduce building cooling energy by 12% and cooling system electric energy by 33%.
