This hands-on workshop will be divided in two main sessions: optimization and model-predictive control

Optimization (2 h)
Presentation of basic optimization principles. Comparison of different approaches to optimize building and system design in TRNSYS with GenOpt or using Matlab as a pre- and post-processor. Hands-on application using case studies for which TRNSYS projects will be provided.

Model-Predictive Control (2 h)
Presentation of Model-Predictive Control principles. Comparison of different approaches to implement MPC in TRNSYS in two distinct cases: using TRNSYS as the controller model for simulation or real-time implementation, and using TRNSYS as the reference model to investigate MPC using models and control algorithms implemented in Matlab through Type 155. Hands-on application using case studies for which TRNSYS projects will be provided.
